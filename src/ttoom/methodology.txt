how to compare
-> generate a set of sims?
-> how to ensure trinket thresholds are the same


**Pseudo-code**
1. Fix first trinket to be x, and look for the second trinket y that produces the maximum hps while satisfying ttoom constraint. (x, y) is the optimal trinket combination given x is fixed
2. Now fix y and look for optimal trinket z.
3. If z == x, this implies that x, y is the optimal trinket combination for the problem; if not, repeat step 2, but this time with z as fixed trinket
4. when (x, y) -> (y, z), where z == x, we have a solution

How many computations? For 10 trinkets, 9 + 8 + 7 = 24 if it requires 3 rounds
